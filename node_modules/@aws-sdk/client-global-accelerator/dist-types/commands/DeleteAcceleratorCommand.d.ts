/**
 * <p>Delete an accelerator. Before you can delete an accelerator, you must disable it and remove all dependent resources
 * 			(listeners and endpoint groups). To disable the accelerator, update the accelerator to set <code>Enabled</code> to false.</p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>When you create an accelerator, by default, Global Accelerator provides you with a set of two static IP addresses.
 * 	        Alternatively, you can bring your own IP address ranges to Global Accelerator and assign IP addresses from those ranges.
 * 		</p>
 *             <p>The IP addresses are assigned to your accelerator for as long as it exists, even if you disable the accelerator and
 * 			it no longer accepts or routes traffic. However, when you <i>delete</i> an accelerator, you lose the
 * 			static IP addresses that are assigned to the accelerator, so you can no longer route traffic by using them.
 * 			As a best practice, ensure that you have permissions in place to avoid inadvertently deleting accelerators. You
 * 			can use IAM policies with Global Accelerator to limit the users who have permissions to delete an accelerator. For more information,
 * 			see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/latest/dg/auth-and-access-control.html">Identity and access management</a> in
 * 		    the <i>Global Accelerator Developer Guide</i>.</p>

 * @example
 * Use a bare-bones client and the command you need to make an API call.
 * ```javascript
 * import { GlobalAcceleratorClient, DeleteAcceleratorCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-global-accelerator"; // ES Modules import
 * // const { GlobalAcceleratorClient, DeleteAcceleratorCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-global-accelerator"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new GlobalAcceleratorClient(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteAcceleratorRequest
 *   AcceleratorArn: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteAcceleratorCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteAcceleratorCommandInput - {@link DeleteAcceleratorCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteAcceleratorCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteAcceleratorCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteAcceleratorCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link GlobalAcceleratorClientResolvedConfig | config} for GlobalAcceleratorClient's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link AcceleratorNotDisabledException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The accelerator that you specified could not be disabled.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link AcceleratorNotFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The accelerator that you specified doesn't exist.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link AssociatedListenerFoundException} (client fault)
 *  <p>The accelerator that you specified has a listener associated with it. You must remove all dependent resources from an
 * 			accelerator before you can delete it.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InternalServiceErrorException} (server fault)
 *  <p>There was an internal error for Global Accelerator.</p>
 *
 * @throws {@link InvalidArgumentException} (client fault)
